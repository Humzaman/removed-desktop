# [removed] for desktop
A userscript to view [removed] and [deleted] comments on reddit.

Unremoves comments using archived data from pushshift.io, and displays the comment inline.

##### Notes:
* Currently only works with the old (and superior) reddit design.
* Tested and works pretty well in Firefox (Greasemonkey and Violentmonkey).
  - I don't use Chrome so idk if there any issues with it
* ~~Doesn't seem to work with RES neverEndingComments, unfortunately. Can't figure out how to listen for new comments, so it only works for comments on the initial page load.~~ **Figured it out. It works now.**
* Hopefully the code isn't too shitty. This is literally my first foray into js stuff lol
